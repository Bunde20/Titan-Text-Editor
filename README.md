## Client Needs
The client would like an application in order to take notes that can be downloaded and is fully functional offline.

## Acceptance Criteria
- WHEN I open my application in my editor:
    - THEN I should see a client server folder structure.
- WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory:
    - THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client.
- WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal:
    - THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack.
- WHEN I run my webpack plugins:
    - THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.
 - WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application:
    - THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors.
 - WHEN I open the text editor:
    - THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage.
 - WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window:
    - THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB.
 - WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it:
    - THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB.
 - WHEN I click on the Install button:
    - THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop.
 - WHEN I load my web application:
    - THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox.
 - WHEN I register a service worker:
    - THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets.
 - WHEN I deploy to Heroku:
    - THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
